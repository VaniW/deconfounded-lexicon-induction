was a happy xxxx card member for years , in late xx/xx/2016 xxxx converted the card portfolio to barclaycard ( xxxx ) . we almost never carry a balance over , but we started to in xx/xx/xxxx and barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month . instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance . so if we charged { $ 3000.00 } last month and carried { $ 3000.00 } from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the { $ 6000.00 } = { $ 75.00 } , should have been { $ 37.00 } in interest charges . they are double dipping , getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase , equal to an 18 % apr ) , plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 % , that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge . i feel this practice is very unethical , if not illegal . we converted , not by our choice , from xxxx to barclaycard mastercard , so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years . completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now . hope you folks over there can investigate .

`` this complaint is regarding wells fargo . xx/xx/xxxx i refinanced my home mortgage taking cash out to make home repairs , pay off an auto loan and pay off an installment loan with wells fargo . on xxxx/xxxx/16 i made the final payment on the installment loan at a local wells fargo branch . this check included a slight overpayment . the payment on the loan , final accrued interest and overpayment were all processed on xxxx/xxxx/16 . on xxxx/xxxx/16 wells fargo reversed the entire amount paid on xxxx/xxxx/16 telling me the loan payoff was coded incorrectly . the representative on the phone told me on xxxx/xxxx/16 the loan payment was being reprocessed and should be back dated to the actual payment date . in the meantime , wells fargo is telling me the same installment loan is past due and put a { $ 39.00 } late charge on the account . on xxxx/xxxx/16 i called customer service to find out why the reprocessing of the loan payoff still had not gone through . i was told it was still in process . on saturday , xxxx/xxxx/16 i went to the local branch where the original payment was made back on xxxx/xxxx/16 . the personal banker called on this same installment loan and was told the payment was not made correctly . and that wells fargo is reprocessing the payment . this personal banker in the branch said everything was applied correctly on her end , so she felt this should be resolved and soon . today , xxxx/xxxx/16 i contacted wells fargo customer service via phone again and was informed the bank check from the title company was returned for insufficient funds twice . we contacted the title company who confirmed verbally the check for the loan cleared their bank on xxxx/xxxx/16 . account numbers and check numbers were confirmed . payments were due on this installment loan on the xxxx of each month . the loan is now xxxx days past due according to wells fargo . yet i have a receipt with a transaction number proving i paid the loan in full on xxxx/xxxx/16 . this loan pay off was rolled into my current mortgage with wells fargo . so i feel they are trying to collect on the same debt twice and/or lost { $ 6800.00 } ! i keep getting told by wells fargo `` '' we need to research this '' but no one can seem to get this resolved .

this is my fifth complaint against key bank because of excessive overdraft fees . i am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest key bank 's posting practices are . unfortunately , this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit . otherwise , i would have an overdraft protection account and i would never incur these fees . this is not only about my funds being low , because actually my funds are n't low right now and i incurred the last xxxx overdraft notices with a positive balance ! now that 's key bank magical accounting for you ! i 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that i am noticing now that i am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on key bank to do the math . some of my items disappear from the ledger at times . the other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly . i will be addressing these things in future complaints . this is takes an incredible amount of my time . i am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts . there is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances . i do n't even know how much i actually have in the bank now . i do n't know how to find out either . i have a ledger that i keep for my own records and it does not coincide with key bank 's accounting . key bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates . i have attached the overdraft notice that i received this morning xx/xx/xxxx . and i have attached the ledger from xx/xx/xxxx copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the xxxx that is credited to the account with the deposit that i made that morning . it shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description . in addition , this same deposit that was made at the atm disappears later in the day . as does the xxxx debit . where do they go ? there is a note that says that key bank is working on the account and some items might not be available , but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the xxxx charge . i have gotten xxxx overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the hassle free account which is my son 's account . they are both my accounts . i should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts . so on xx/xx/xxxx i started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited xxxx into my account . yet i bounced xxxx items , though i was only charged for xxxx . this is very unclear unprofessional accounting . if i did not have direct deposits coming into this account , i would close it . and the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business . they do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that i have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance . get it together key bank . adding and subtracting are basic math skills that you should have . stop reordering items to benefit yourselves . give people a break . last month you bounced xxxx debit transactions of mine that came all together to a little over xxxx you made almost xxxx $ off of those transactions .

in xxxx of xxxx i bought a new car . the dealer told me that i would be contacted by citizen one ( then rbs citizens ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due . sometime shortly after that citizen one sent me my first monthly billing statement . for the next 2 1/2 years citizen one set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements . during that time i faithfully made each payment on time and , on several occasions , made monthly payments for several months in advance . for these reasons i relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from citizen one to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment . in xxxx xxxx citizen one suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements . i did n't notice ( i had been habituated by their monthly notices and i had been trained to think of sending a payment only after i was notified ) and , as a direct result of citizen one 's failure to send a monthly billing statement , i was late with my xxxx payment . when their credit department contacted me i sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that i had n't received a statement . their customer service representative told me that i should have received a monthly billing statement , it was citizen one 's policy to do so , verified my contact information ( which had n't changed ) and , under the circumstances , waived the { $ 20.00 } fee i had been assessed for being late . she also assured me that i would start to receive monthly billing statements again . unfortunately , i did not . nor did i notice . as a result of that failure on the part of citizen one i was again contacted in xxxx by their credit department that i was late again . i immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me . mail it , fax it , e-mail it - i did n't care . just get one to me . this time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders . to date i have n't received either . as a result i was late again in xxxx . i am not accusing citizen one of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but i find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident . i am never - and i do mean never - late with any of my other bills . i also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that citizen one gains from their own failure ! they are now refusing to waive xxxx { $ 20.00 } late fees . something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that i am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due . furthermore , i should not be charged { $ 20.00 } fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on citizen one 's part to send me a monthly billing statement . i suspect that i am not the only customer of citizen one with this problem . i have made exhaustive efforts to remedy this issue with the bank but they are intransigent and so i am filing this compliant to get this situation resolved and , on the principles of being fair and taking responsibility for their part in creating this problem , get the outstanding late fees waived and ensure delivery of a monthly billing statement .

'' this means that if a debt collector reports a date of first delinquency to the credit bureaus and the original creditor previously reported it , the dates must be the same date of first delinquency . any different date constitutes illegal re-aging . this re-aging of my accounts has cause serious damage to my credit files , i 'm hoping that this will be corrected quickly since i am provided my previous credit reports as attachments as evidence of the original dates of the first delinquency reported . the credit report i received from equifax would be empty if not for the re-aging of the remaining accounts on your credit report , because the fcra requires that information reported be in compliance with the date of first delinquency and the name of the party who reported the date of first delinquency . xxxx xxxx filed their first notice of delinquency when i requested that the scra interest rate adjustment to the account because i had been making payments in access of the required amounts and the balance of the account was n't reflecting that . their attorney stated that xxxx xxxx was n't required to grant my request for the scra because the contract interest rate was below 5 % and any excess payments were applied to the other fees and charges . xxxx does n't have the legal right to deny mt scra request without first having a court order granting them the right not to comply with the federal statutes of the scra financial protections and the scra interest rate provision requires a creditor not to accelerate the account for non payments of the obligation until the scra requirements are in compliance , ignoring my scra request is n't permitted without a court order and the attorney should have known .

i had a private school loan that i was unaware had gone into collection that my xxxx had cosigned for . as soon as i was made aware of the status of my loan i immediately made payment arrangements with the collection company xxxx xxxx xxxx . i set up automatic withdraws from my checking account and had paid faithfully since i became aware of the loan . i was leaving to go on a mission trip in xxxx xx/xx/2016 so i made certain that my payment arrangements would still be taken out of my account while i was out of the country because i knew that i would be unable to have constant internet connection during my trip in remote areas . i also had budgeted my finances accordingly to make sure i had available funds in my account to cover my monthly payments of { $ 87.00 } . unfortunately , while abroad i had to have an emergency xxxx operation which caused me to have a month long hospital stay in xxxx , xxxx . there were many complications with my xxxx and my right xxxx was not functional for several weeks post operation . i had to learn to walk again not to mention i was dealing with my travel insurance who was refusing to pay my covered expenses . i wrote an email to xxxx letting them know that i was abroad and going through a tough time . in my email i asked if i could postpone my payments or lower them while i was recovering in the hospital , could figure out what was going on with my insurance and make it back to the united states . they replied to me via email stating that i needed to call them at a specific number never mentioning anything about adjusting my payment arrangement . at this time i did n't have a data plan , was unable to independently walk or get out of bed and had limited wifi connectivity . i messaged my father to call xxxx on my behalf and explain the situation . my father had all of my information to make such a call but xxxx refused to disclose any information or take note of what was going on . 3 days after i received correspondence from xxxx i had a friend check my available balance and xxxx had withdrawn the entire amount of my payment agreement for that month . i assumed that since no one was able to make contact or confirm that there would be changes made to my payment arrangements that the full amount would be withdrawn each month . it was a very difficult time after my emergency xxxx with medications , learning how to walk again and dealing with insurance and physical therapy . around xxxx and a half months after i was xxxx from the hospital i started to have more complications which caused me to be re-hospitalized again in xxxx . luckily this time i was well enough to make the trip back to the xxxx to have a second emergency xxxx xxxx which i am in the progress of recovering from currently . upon returning to the xxxx , my uncle who cosigned for the loan contacted me and said that xxxx were harassing him with rude phone calls and threats of being sued because i had defaulted on my loan . i was shocked at this news . i checked my account and saw that xxxx had stopped withdrawing my payments . i called xxxx to figure out what happened and it took 2 months of me calling and asking until they finally admitted they had stopped the payments . when i asked why , the rep said because i had asked them to in an email . i was never notified that they made xxxx changes to my payment arrangement or the stipulations of said changes . this has hurt mine and my xxxx 's credit negatively and we are still receiving harassing phone calls daily . my xxxx had a family emergency recently and needed to refinance his house and was denied because the defaulted loan is shown on his credit report . it has also effected his job because the credit cards have lowered his credit limit in which he needs because he has to travel internationally . i only owe { $ 1000.00 }	Debt collection	False statements or representation	IN	Closed with explanation	Yes	0.234792021893	3.92593158162

`` what happened : my concern and problem with my bank , revolves around my checking account and the line of credit attached to it . my current , checking account has an existing line of credit for { $ 1000.00 } dollars , which is both a personal and business checking , in xxxx account . i 've had this bank account since xx/xx/xxxx and the line of credit on this account since xx/xx/xxxx . what is my concern ? two-fold : first my bank poaches my account . how does the bank do that ? my original line of credit was set up so that i will always receive my monthly bank payment allotment ( comes from the department of treasury for a pension payment ) on the day of the month , before the payment for the bank fees are due . no matter how many times in the past i tried to change the set-up so the dates would align in my favor thus avoiding overdraft fees , it never worked that way . my allotment is like clock work , it always arrives on the xxxx day of the month via ach , unless there is a holiday , or the month ends on a weekend . in which case my funds credit a day prior . the regular , reoccurring , direct deposit payment always comes on or before the xxxx of every month , and sometimes sooner , but never later . but the bank does not always credit when they receive my direct deposit thus resulting in small problems with my account . my original use of the line of credit meant that if i had an overage the bank would cover it until my incoming deposit would offset the cost . thus not charging me for an overdraft , or other banking errors , or fees . but the bank finds ways around that either by taking maintenance payments early or holding up my deposit an extra day . even though i have had this account for a very long time ( since xx/xx/xxxx ) the bank takes advantage of me and poaches my account . my bank waits to collect the amount for my account maintenance fees ( usually about { $ 20.00 } ) until a day before the direct deposit , not a day after as i had originally set it up . the bank is not open on sunday or saturday but they will balance a maintenance payment against my account on a sunday if the payment arrives on monday . even if i wanted to correct the problem i ca n't since the bank is closed and with a payment already scheduled it resolves itself . second problem with this besides the costs to me , is the bank uses the overages to show a pattern that they now say is shutting down my line of credit . what my bank is doing is over-drafting my bank account by collecting a maintenance fee within 24 hours of my incoming direct deposit and even if i 'm only xxxx cents overdrawn and have a pending deposit to offset it , they collect the overdraft fees 1st . i am calling this `` '' poaching '' since my bank does this deliberately by aligning payments , fees and overages to happen before the direct deposit although they often happen within a day of each other . many years ago to stop my bank from taking advantage of me in this way i called and spoke to my banker . he told me the bank is not allowed to collect maintenance fees that will overdraft my account . he said that if a maintenance fee is due when funds come into the account it covers that cost ( maintenance fee ) thus always balancing itself , before an overdraft . but many years go by and the bank keeps taking the maintenance fees and over-drafting my account by a few dollars , or less , for a { $ 20.00 } payment that is n't even over due more than 24 hours . and they do it when the bank is closed . the bank seems to know my direct deposit is coming so they collect the payment first and if there is a discrepancy of even a few cents they charge me an overdraft up to { $ 45.00 } . because this all happens within a day or so , the transactions happen without any time opportunity for me to correct anything to avoid this problem . originally , i set-it up so my direct deposit would always come first , before the bank fees are balanced against the account to avoid this problem .

i first requested a hamp modification/ refinance xx/xx/xxxx , i had just been let go from my job and was 3 months behind on my mortgage , the man assigned to my mortgage said it was not the right time to apply because i had no income . he suggested i go on a furlough and pay { $ 25.00 } each month instead of my full mortgage for 6 months and then apply for the hamp ; during this time there would be no action taken on foreclosing my property . i accepted the furlough and much to my surprise at the end of the six months i was now 8 months behind in my mortgage , he never said i would continue to collect months in arrears while on the forbearance . he is obligated to tell me the terms of the agreement before i agreed to the forbearance ? correct ? why i was not told ? i had difficulty getting this person to return my calls and work on the hamp with me ; i complained at the bank location near me when i went to make a mortgage payment and was told i could not make a payment because i was in foreclosure ! the lady at the bank contacted this man 's department and had a new person assigned to my case . he caused several weeks delay in getting the hamp started which is now affecting my timeline to beat the foreclosure . he was the problem why am i penalized ? for the last several weeks i have been gathering documents , turning them in , getting additional requests for documents , sending those in and again getting a request for additional documents , which i just turned in yesterday . nearly xxxx pages in total , seems they are dragging out the process on purpose to slow my progress to getting an answer on the hamp . i discovered on my own , the option of having a non-borrower 's income included in the households income for the hamp , i believe i should have been told of this option since i have a significant other who had lived in the home for 1.5 years . he agreed to participate to help me keep the home . why i was not informed about this option ? again it is as if they want me to fail to get the hamp . as i mentioned before , i was told that during this time no action would be taken toward foreclosing on my property ; however i was served with a summons on xxxx/xxxx/xxxx . i believe the documents i have supplied are being sent to an underwriter as they are received , and have been getting evaluated all along , this is why they keep requesting more documents ; therefor , no action should have been taken on the foreclosure at this time . why is this happening ? i had not secured employment , i told the bank i am having debilitating mental health issues , for which i am applying for social security xxxx , which can take up to 2 years . i started a xxxx ( xxxx xxxx ) which is made a xxxx ( xxxx ) i told the bank about this , they said i needed 2 years of self-employment income to be considered for the hamp , but would try anyway . i was not offered the additional 6 months furlough which i was qualified for , nor did they agree to make the arrears caused by the furlough into a second mortgage which would then be forgiven as part of the hamp modification . why am i not being offered all options available to me ? the bank also told me the only thing they will do if i qualify for the hamp is make my mortgage ( which i have been paying on for 15 years ) into a 40 year mortgage . my interest rate for the last 15 years has been 6.4 % , more than double the rates over the last 6 years , why not give me a concession there ? my principle balance is { $ 65000.00 } , i paid { $ 92000.00 } for the home in xx/xx/xxxx and it has at least { $ 40000.00 } in equity at this time . why not reduce the principle . why are all the options on the governments hamp site not being offered/considered for my case ? someone please help me .

xx/xx/xxxx , i informed us bank to please not call me any longer at work my work phone number . they did stop doing this for about a month and then i called to speak with a rep back on xxxx/xxxx/2015 around xxxx xxxx pst . i was asking him about doing a skip payment for my car loan because i was unable to make a payment . during this conversation , he repeatedly asked for my phone number for work . i told him that i do not wish to give out my phone number to my work , i do not want phone calls at work . i explained to him that i had already told them that no phone calls should ever be made and i do not have to give a work phone number at all . he demanded one from me and i still refused and he informed me that i would not be able to do a skip payment unless i gave him a work phone number ( thus now i am past due because i refuse to give him my work phone number ) . the very next day , us bank started calling my work phone number . they stopped for a few days after , but have called me xxxx times a day since monday xxxx/xxxx/2015 . apparently , telling people not to call you at a phone number , or refusing to give one for work , means you ca n't ask for help and then they pull up your previous numbers and start harassing you there -- even though i specifically said not to call me at work . i also completed a survey after this phone call and asked that someone please follow up with me , no one has ever reached out to me for assistance . secondly , when i asked for help , this young man wanted to delve into details of why i could pay . what was causing the issue , how i was going to fix it and if i could not provide this then i would not be able to skip a payment . this should not be a requirement to skip a payment . i 've never done so on my car loan so asking for help once i should be given an okay -- but not asked about details in my personal life . just telling them i ca n't afford to pay should be enough .

i used to have voice over internet with the carrier called xxxx now known as xxxx xxxx and about a year and a half ago i discontinued telephone service with them . however there was an incident in which i moved and in that move i lost a little box that was necessary to voice over telephone calling . the box was about the same size as a deck of cards . i contacted xxxx and explained that the little box had somehow gotten lost in the moves.they said that i owed them { $ 100.00 } dollars for the box . i explained to xxxx that it was an honest mistake and due to me having to move twice in two months , that it was an mistake in which i had ultimately no control over the situation being that the movers were moving me and i explained that i could not afford to pay for the box and that since i was a loyal customer for four years i felt that they should have honored my reasons . i was never again contacted by xxxx . about a year later i began receiving harassing telephone calls from a collection agency stating that they represented xxxx and that they were trying to collect { $ 120.00 } . i asked them what for and they said i owed them money for the lost box . i explained to the collection agency what the situation was and why i did not feel that i should be held responsible for a little lost box and that mistakes happen . i told them that i was filing a complaint . i recently reviewed my credit report and found that i have a collection item reported by the collection agency who supposedly was representing xxxx . i feel that this wrong being that xxxx never contacted me again nor tried to call and discuss the situation and for them to do this is really bad business after i had a legitimate and very logical reason for the issue . i would never deliberately not send a little box back to a company for no good reason . i think what xxxx did was wrong and i do not feel that i owe them anything . this is how xxxx treats it former loyal customer 's ? i want the derogatory information that xxxx supplied to be removed from my credit report and i want the harassing phone calls to stop . i am requesting your help with this matter and please advise . thank you . xxxx xxxx	Debt collection	Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed	NY	Closed with non-monetary relief	Yes	0.595418415449	3.71512069759

i have been having issues with chase bank regarding my mortgage modification . when i started with chase my home was about to go into foreclosure and that was the only company that would take my account and give me a mortgage . i had just bought a new house with a 7.25 % interest rate . but when i went to refinance with chase to keep my first home out of foreclosure a few months later they gave me a rate at 15.25 % xxxx the original rate for that house was 8.5 % ) . yes i was late from time to time but i always paid more than the monthly payments and late fees . i am retired now and my income has decreased so i have been trying to work on a modification with chase for a lower interest rate . i have been repeatedly contacting chase and they are always telling me we just need this one more piece of information each time i call , and i am never really given a straight answer when i ask where the equity in my house went . i have been paying on this loan for xxxx years . the house is only worth xxxx and i have paid almost xxxx the amount of the original cost of the house at the time of purchase . i have to admit that over the years i never stopped to take the time to look at my bills . now that i 'm retired and on a fixed income i 've noticed discrepancies in my bills and have questions i should have asked years ago . my original mortgage was released to chase xx/xx/1999 . it is still not clear to me how my interest rate would jump from 8.5 to 15.25 % . it also does n't seem right for my balance to be the same every month after each payment . the modification that they are taking so long to answer about will add another 66 years to the loan . i just want someone to look at why they are giving me a run around about my modification . i apparently have a subprime loan , and i am trying to get out of it . they keep suggesting a quick sale but after xxxx years of paying on this house the thought of giving up is disheartening . my monthly payment is xxxx a month i pay xxxx and only xxxx goes toward the principal xxxx goes to interest .

my complaint involves xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx . i applied for an auto loan through xxxx , and shortly after i received a call from xxxx xxxx ( not sure of spelling ; her direct line is xxxx ) at xxxx xxxx ( xxxx of xxxx ) preferred dealers . i was told that i had been approved ( approved , not pre-approved ) for a { $ 35000.00 } car loan with no money down , but they could only discuss details such as ltv ratios or interest rates with me in person . she assured me they had a lender with an approval . i arrived at the dealership , and was immediately asked to fill out a credit app - i was told this was to make sure i was who i said i was . they assured me that they would not run my credit or submit to any banks . then they appraised my trade and the sales guy said he could n't tell me how much they were offering because his boss keep that all secret . next , they tell me i can no longer get the used xxxx i wanted due to the ltv and would have to get a new altima . at this point i had to get back to work , and the plan was for me to return to the dealership around xxxx to finalize the paperwork . at xxxx , i phoned the sales man , and he refused to tell me anything at all - not how much my trade was worth , or even a range of what my monthly payments might be . it 's an xxxx drive from my office , and i smelled a rat , so i decided not to return . i just got home from work and saw that the dealership out about xxxx hard inquiries to banks while i was in the waiting room earlier in the day . what a scam . they lied about the loan approval for the sole purpose of getting me in the door ( over an xxxx drive each way ) . it appears to me they are running a special finance cattle call . deceptive trade practices & false advertisement - they never did have a lender or an approval . my guess is they lied to get me in the door and figured they 'd find a way to sell me a car once i was physically there . truth in lending - they submitted credit applications to over xxxx banks . i 've asked for copies of what they sent to the banks regarding my applications , and was refused access . i am accusing them of submitting false credit applications on my behalf .

`` i recently fell on hard times due to the loss of a job back in xx/xx/2016 ; at no fault of my own.i reached out to my creditors to alert them of my hardship in hopes of getting some assistance . each time i 've spoken to a representative from chase auto finance , whether they call me ( multiple calls daily on an auto-dialer to my cell phone ) or i call in , i am threatened with repossession. `` '' xxxx xxxx , in reviewing the notes on your account , i do see that the account is being reviewed for repossession . '' the account can be 10 days past due , and the threats continue throughout the call , even when i 've given them a date in which the payment will be made . not one time , has a representative offered a hardship deferment or a payment arrangement to get the account back on track . it 's become unbearable to even speak to them at this point . i reached out to them one last time and got a representative by the name of xxxx ( he read his employee id off so fast , i could barely catch it ) possible employee id : xxxx . i began to tell him about the hardship i faced that from a job loss and shortly after purchasing the vehicle ( using my offer letter for a new job ) in xx/xx/xxxx . he interrupted me to tell me my account is being reviewed for repossession . while the comment was hard to ignore , i moved on to ask if they had a deferment option for one of the payments ( currently 2 behind ) and explained my plan to take care of the other . he then said that i had an affordability issue . how he came to that conclusion without asking me for my income & debt , i 'm not sure . i expressed to him that this account was not the only one behind so when i began to work last month , i had to catch up priority items such as electric and water first which took up the majority of my first xxxx paychecks ; however , they did receive a payment from my first paycheck . i had to advise him again that affordability did not apply to this situation . i can and will be able to make the payments going forward as i actually make more money now than i did when they financed the vehicle . i also explained how i was able to maintain the payments from xx/xx/xxxx thru xx/xx/xxxx which included unemployment and selling items on xxxx . i wanted to express to him that i will make the payment no matter the cost . he went back to saying `` '' see , since you have to sell stuff , you ca n't afford this payment . '' i had to ask him to stop talking and actively listen as i was answering his question regarding how i made the payments during the time i was unemployed . he then placed me on hold for several minutes , came back and said that i do not qualify for a deferment because the account is so new and in order to qualify for the deferment , i would need to make both payments by xx/xx/xxxx or my vehicle will be reposessed . i was hoping that did n't make sense to him because if i could pay both payments , i would no longer need a deferment . he then threatened me with repossession again . i am uncertain if this threat tactic is coming from the top , but it needs to stop . that threat is not going to move anyone any faster to cure the account if they simply do not have it . what it will make us do is allow them to repossess the vehicle and file complaints on their tactics as any smart consumer knows that it costs banks more to process and repossess a vehicle than it does to work with their customer who is facing a temporary hardship . if there was an affordability issue based on my income , that means , i did not qualify for the loan to begin with and the loan should not have been approved . i can afford my payments , and i can afford to make two payments , i just can not do so all at once . i find it unsettling that none of the reps i have encountered over the last several months presented options to keep me as a customer . even a payment arrangement to give me a little more time would have sufficed .

( `` '' principal-only '' payments are another matter -- this is about partial payments here , not extra payments . ) what 's worse : i do n't earn interest on a suspense account like i would in a savings account . the savings quote assumes payments are immediately applied to the loan : that is the only way to save on accruing interest . otherwise , there is no benefit to doing this if the lender waits until the full amount is there . if the lender does n't accept the payments , then the service consumers are paying for is not being rendered and they are getting no benefit for the consideration being paid . is n't that breach of contract ? who would set up a payment plan to only pay fees and not get any benefits ? companies such as the nba do a disservice to borrowers and should not exist . this is the sort of company the cfpb should protect consumers from . the xxxx gave this company an `` '' a '' ranking but they defraud consumers . read some of the comments on the xxxx website to get an idea . even if the nba offered a legitimate service , they charge a fee for something that would be available through the mortgage lender or the servicer for no cost . it also would n't hurt to define `` '' xxxx-time '' homebuyers as a legally protected class and make the fines for defrauding them extra steep just to deter this kind of predatory behavior . i have a copy of the letter available .

while i have tried to get aes to see reason ( see attached letter ) they are insisting on maintaining their slanderous position with the credit reporting agencies . as aes 's false statements are of a civil nature , i would have to take them to court , incurring substantial cost , in order to force them to report fairly and honestly . however , as the federal agency charged with protecting citizens from having lies and slanderous information reported on their credit reports , i implore you to force the credit agencies to strike all false information from my credit report . as anyone with eyes can see , these are xxxx invoices consisting of multiple consolidated loans against each . to report that i missed xxxx and xxxx payments , respectively , instead of xxxx payments total , is a lie and a violation of the fair credit reporting act . as the credit reporting agencies always seem to take the side of the reporting company ( which , i understand , pays a fee in order to report credit information ) , citizens such as myself look to the federal credit reporting agency to protect us from what amounts to a monopoly on credit information , which we have extremely limited control over . where is the equity in the system when xxxx missed payments can drop a credit score from xxxx to xxxx ( more than xxxx points ) , especially when the payments were missed due to lack of a monthly billing being sent by eh creditor . this letter concerns late payments made by me for the reference ( xxxx ) and ( xxxx ) accounts , which are for the following loan sequences , respectively : account number : xxxx xxxx xxxx loan sequences : xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx account number : xxxx xxxx xxxx loan sequences : xxxx xxxx while i admit that the xxxx 2015 payments for these accounts was made more than 30 days late , i did not receive a bill for xxxx . while i agree that i still would be responsible to make the payment , like most people , i pay my bills when i receive notification in the mail that it is due . when i called to dispute the information you reported to the credit bureaus , and informed them of the above , they advised that the xxxx billings for both accounts was sent out , according to your records . that xxxx be , but i did not receive them . i was also informed that i could set up automatic deductions from my bank accounts . i declined , as , due to identity theft concerns , i do not have any automatic deductions from my bank account . once this error was made clear to me , i made sure that both accounts were up to date , as they are now . during the call , your representative indicated that she did not have the authority to remove the derogatory information from my credit report . she also stated that it was not legal to remove derogatory information from a credit report , which is not true . the derogatory information that aes reported to the credit bureaus is both unfair and in accurate . it is unfair because , as stated above , i did not receive a xxxx 2015 billing . it is inaccurate because it reports xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx late payments , when in fact there were only xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx . as shown above , and as detailed in the attachments , i only have xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx accounts with aes . these accounts represent xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx sequences , respectively , but they are not separate payments . because this false derogatory information was reported to the credit bureaus , my credit score dropped xxxx points overnight . this represents slander , and resulting harm . based on the above , i demand that aes remove the false , inaccurate and slanderous derogatory information from by credit reports . if this is not done within xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx days , i will initiate legal action against aes and the credit bureaus for slander , with appropriate demands for monetary damages . i strongly advise you to take immediate action as directed herein .

i used to live in campus habitat apartments for 3 years from xx/xx/xxxx to xx/xx/xxxx . the place was filthy disgusting and consistently was being bought out by a new management company every few months . they also had buildings with condemned apartments in them and almost were shut down due to how disgusting they are . a few months before our lease ended , our kitchen started to leak water from somewhere . we did n't know if it was dishwasher , sink what it was but it got to the point that we had about xxxx-xxxx inches of standing water in our kitchen . we made numerous phone calls to the office asking for someone to come take care of it and they refused . we let them know that if they did not take care of it we would not pay rent until they did . so we lived there for 2 months without paying rent and the problem never being fixed . our apartment continuing to leak water all over the kitchen every time we cleaned it up again . when we moved out , we went to the office to hand in our keys and let them know that we did not clean up all the towels and stuff we had on the floor due to the water damage because it was not our fault and we were disgusted . we also let them know that the rent would not be paid for that because part of our lease states they were to respond to maintenance requests and they never did so since they did n't hold up their end of the lease agreement , we would not pay . we lived with a flooded kitchen and disgusting smell of molded wet towels barely even able to cook or pack up in our kitchen . i gave them the address to our new apartment for my security deposit and such and left . 1 year later i go to apply to a new complex with my boyfriend and i find that i am declined . when i ask why they state it was because i owe money to xxxx xxxx and that it 's on my credit report . this comes as a shock to me as i had moved out of that apartment over a year ago and have never received a phone call , letter , invoice nothing stating that i owed any money to them . i knew that i had refused to pay rent for 2 months but since they never sent anything to me asking for payment nor contacted me about it on the phone , i assumed they let it go as they were wrong by not making my apartment xxxx livable and i could take them to court over it . so i contacted them after looking at my credit report and seeing that on xx/xx/xxxx they placed me with a collections agency regarding my past due money . when i contacted them i asked what besides my rent they were trying to claim i owed them , as my rent was not enough to equate to { $ 1100.00 } at all . they claimed i owed for some damages , repainting and re-carpeting and such as well because they had no record of anyone 's move in sheets that were filled out 3 years prior since they company had been bought out by so many different new management companies during that time . they also could not provide me with a written statement or invoice for a breakdown of the charges they told me just to come in and write a check . at this point it was also yet another company that owned them than what it was when i moved out . i expressed that i wanted a manager to call me back immediately to dispute this because it was absolutely obscene and i never received a phone call . to this day , i still have not received a phone call , written notice or invoice . somehow they also could not explain why i never received a security deposit back or why that did not pay towards the balance . and i also now see that the complex themselves not only has yet another new management company but they have an entirely new name for the apartments . i do not know who to contact to get this account off my credit report as a negative mark . i do n't know if i have to take them to small claims to dispute it and show them pictures of the disgusting hallways and apartments and condemned buildings with broken locks and all this information .

bank of america closed my credit card account with notice , immediately after i paid off the balance on the card with the intention of using the card for new purchases . a credit card holder should be able to reasonably rely upon access to their line of credit . if the bank can just close the account without notice , the card holder could be put at risk , e.g . if the cardholder is traveling or if there is an emergency . a bank should give reasonable notice to the cardholder before closing an account , in view of the fact that closing an account can create a serious hardship for a cardholder , even placing the cardholder in physical jeopardy , e.g . if the cardholder is traveling without access to other funds . moreover , my account was closed shortly after i paid off the balance on the account , because i wanted to free up the available credit for new purchases . the timing of the account closure is suspicious and suggests that bank of america waited for me to pay off the account before closing the account . in other words , the timing suggests that the account was flagged for closure because the balance had been paid off . obviously , this kind of closure tactic maximizes the risk of financial hardship , because people often pay off credit cards with the intention of then using the freed up credit . finally , this account closure tactic has an additional harm beyond placing the cardholder at risk of hardship -- it also harms the cardholder 's credit score . if banks close accounts because credit scores are low , this has a snowball effect , because the closures worsen the credit scores , perhaps leading to further account closures , and further worsening of credit scores . this enhances the need for reasonable notice and process before account closure .

chase is the bank named in this complaint , but from the posted deposit and overdraft agreements of other banks , their policies are the same . when you do n't maintain a certain balance in an account , you do n't qualify for the fee-free accounts . so already you are paying a monthly fee . but let 's say you misjudged the amount of time it would take a check you sent out to post to your account , or had an auto-pay bill post before your deposit goes in ; then chase will take all your incoming debits and post them in the order of largest to smallest . this means that , even though you have enough money in the account to cover all the transaction but the last one , their posting method guarantees that they can charge as many overdraft fees of { $ 34.00 } as there are transactions after the largest wipes out the balance . in my business account 's case , a { $ 25.00 } payment ( here 's the irony ) , to chase credit card , was charged a { $ 34.00 } od fee , because it was posted after a { $ 150.00 } check . so after all transaction posted , the account was overdrawn by { $ 110.00 } , { $ 68.00 } of which were overdraft charges . and that 's only on xxxx transactions . had i had more transactions posting , each and every one of them would have cost { $ 34.00 } . this could become an insurmountable amount . i have a small , struggling business that does n't always have the best cash flow , and chase and other banks take full advantage of this by penalizing me xxxx ways . one is by charging a monthly fee for being poor , the other by posting transaction to cause the most amount of damage , and take the most amount of money from the very people who can least afford it . this practice should be stopped , and a federally regulated policy for overdraft charges should be in place . i am all for paying a monthly fee to use my account , as it is a service i appreciate . but to be outright robbed of precious few dollars i may have , because of greed and morally corrupt corporations , this should not stand . and our regulators need to protect us from these type of widespread corruptive practices .

`` i graduated from xxxx xxxx university in 2012 , but prior to my enrollment there i attended for for profit vocational school , xxxx xxxx ( xxxx , az ) . during this time i accrued private student loan debt which was held in forbearance while i attend school . upon graduation i consolidated my federal loans into xxxx , and have regularly made payments on an income based plan . when i graduated my cosigner was in bankruptcy thus resulting in me not having to pay on the private loan . i was never made aware that private loans could not be consolidated with my federal loans , and assumed i was managing my student loan debt as responsibly as i was able . this however changed when my cosigners bankruptcy ended and i was sent a bill for a payment i could not afford . over the past xxxx months myself and my cosigner , my mother have made attempts to contact navient to discuss repayment options , and have both been told that the only option i have is an `` '' interest only '' repayment . this only lowered the payment by less than xxxx dollars and was still not affordable . i recently sent them a letter asking if other options had become available and was sent a letter back stating they will not discuss it in writing .
